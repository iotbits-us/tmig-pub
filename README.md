# A Telegraf - Influxdb & Grafana Docker-compose stack

### Introduction

The aim of this repo is to provide easy deployable [Grafana Monitoring](https://grafana.com/) stack  using [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) as data collector from several sources, with focus in MQTT in this repo  we subscribe to topics  from [Modbusbox](https://mbox.iotbits.net/docs/introduction)  connected to VFD,  we also include a sonoff  WI-FI temperature & Humidity sensor. There are many aspects of this guide  that can be improved , it take me while to get working properly some bash scripts, since I am not a expert in such programming language.
